Project 4: Analyze A/B Test Results (Simulated)

Objective

The goal is to simulate an A/B test scenario where a company is deciding whether to launch a new webpage (the Treatment group) or keep the old one (the Control group). We will use statistical methods to determine if the new page leads to a significant difference in conversion rate.
